Description: The semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model is an attractive alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model. This package provides a suite of functions for fitting one popular estimator of the semiparametric AFT model, the regularized Gehan estimator. Specifically, we provide functions for cross-validation, prediction, coefficient extraction, and visualizing both trace plots and cross-validation curves. For further details, please see Suder, P. M. and Molstad, A. J., (2022+) Scalable algorithms for semiparametric accelerated failure time models in high dimensions, to appear in Statistics in Medicine <doi:10.1002/sim.9264>.
